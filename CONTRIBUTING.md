## Translations

To add your language to the extension for UI components, follow these steps:

- Inside the `templates` directory, find the `[messages.example.json](https://github.com/Umit-Ulusoy/discord-msdel/blob/development/templates/messages.example.json)` file. This file contains the translation template.
- Copy this `[messages.example.json](https://github.com/Umit-Ulusoy/discord-msdel/blob/development/templates/messages.example.json)` file to the appropriate location: `/_locales/lang_code/messages.json`. Replace `lang_code` with the language code (e.g., `en`, `fr`, `de`, etc.).
- Follow the instructions and examples in the template to fill in the `message` fields for the new language.
- Test the translation in the project to ensure everything works as expected.
